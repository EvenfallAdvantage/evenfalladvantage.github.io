# Student Portal Integration - Complete

## Overview
Successfully integrated the EASandTable training platform into the Evenfall Advantage website as the "Student Portal". The integration provides a dual-portal system for students and clients.

## What Was Done

### 1. Directory Structure Created
```

├── student-portal/
│   ├── index.html (adapted from EASandTable)
