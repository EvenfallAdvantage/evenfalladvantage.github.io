**To implement:**
1. Create a `messages` table in Supabase
2. Build messaging UI (inbox, compose, threads)
3. Real-time message notifications
4. Update `contactCandidate()` function

**Suggested Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    from_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    to_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    subject TEXT,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
