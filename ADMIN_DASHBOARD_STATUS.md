## ⚠️ Partially Implemented

### Client Management
- Need to add viewClient() and editClient() functions (similar to students)
- Need to add updateClient() function

### Attendance/Rosters
- Basic UI structure exists
- Needs full implementation:
  - Create roster modal
  - Manage attendance
  - Mark present/absent
  - Generate reports

### Course Management
- Basic display of modules
- Needs:
  - Create course modal
  - Edit course functionality
  - Course content management
  - Enrollment tracking

## 🔧 Known Limitations

### User Creation
- Uses `signUp()` instead of admin API (requires email confirmation)
- **Workaround**: Manually confirm users in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- **Better Solution**: Create Supabase Edge Function with service role for user creation

### Database Triggers Needed
Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to auto-create student/client records:

```sql
-- Trigger to auto-create student record on signup
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_student()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'user_type' = 'student' THEN
    INSERT INTO students (id, email, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES (
      NEW.id,
      NEW.email,
      NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'first_name',
      NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'last_name'
    );
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created_student
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_student();

-- Trigger to auto-create client record on signup
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_client()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'user_type' = 'client' THEN
    INSERT INTO clients (id, email, first_name, last_name, company_name)
    VALUES (
      NEW.id,
      NEW.email,
      NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'first_name',
      NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'last_name',
      NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'company_name'
    );
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created_client
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_client();
```

## 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Add database triggers** (see above) - Makes user creation work properly
2. **Implement client view/edit modals** - Copy student implementation
3. **Add attendance roster system**:
   - Create roster with date, course, location
   - Add students to roster
   - Mark attendance
   - View attendance history
4. **Enhance course management**:
   - Create/edit courses
   - Manage course content
   - Track enrollments
5. **Add reporting features**:
   - Student progress reports
   - Certificate reports
   - Attendance reports
   - Export to PDF/CSV

## 🚀 How to Use

### Setup
1. Run `ADMIN_SETUP.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Create admin user in Supabase Auth
3. Add user to administrators table
4. Run database triggers SQL (above)

### Access
1. Go to portal selection page
2. Look for tiny dot (•) at bottom
3. Click to access admin login
4. Login with admin credentials

### Features
- **Students**: Create, view, edit, delete student accounts
- **Clients**: Create, view, delete client accounts  
- **Certificates**: Issue certificates to students, view all certificates
- **Overview**: See statistics and recent activity

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Bucket not found" error
- Create `certifications` bucket in Supabase Storage
- Make it public
- Run storage policies SQL

### Users not appearing after creation
- Check Supabase Auth → Users (they should be there)
- Manually confirm email if needed
- Add database triggers (see above)

### Permission errors
- Verify RLS policies are set correctly
- Check user is in administrators table
- Ensure authenticated as admin

## 📝 Notes

- Admin dashboard is fully responsive
- All CRUD operations have loading states
- Error messages are user-friendly
- Data is real-time from Supabase
- No hardcoded data - everything is dynamic
