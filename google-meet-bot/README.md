```

Or with npm:

4. **Posts responses** back to the chat
5. **Stays active** throughout the session

## Usage During Training

### Starting the Bot

1. Create your Google Meet session
2. Copy the meeting URL
3. Run: `node index.js <meeting-url>`
4. Bot will join automatically

### During the Session

- Students ask questions in the chat
- Bot responds with Clunt Westwood's expertise
- Instructor can focus on teaching while bot handles Q&A
- Bot has knowledge of all 8 modules

### Stopping the Bot

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully shut down the bot

## Customization

### Change Bot Name

Edit `index.js` line 47:
```javascript
await nameInput.type('Your Custom Name');
```

### Adjust Response Time

Edit `index.js` line 74 (monitoring interval):
```javascript
setInterval(async () => {
  // Check every 2 seconds (2000ms)
}, 2000);
```

### Enable Headless Mode

For production, edit `index.js` line 19:
```javascript
headless: true, // Bot runs invisibly
```

## Troubleshooting

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Google Meet Limitations:**
- Bot appears as a participant (counts toward limit)
- May require approval to join meeting
- Chat monitoring depends on Google Meet's interface

‚ö†Ô∏è **API Costs:**
- Each question/response uses ElevenLabs API credits
- Monitor your usage in ElevenLabs dashboard

‚ö†Ô∏è **Best Practices:**
- Test bot before live training sessions
- Have backup plan if bot fails
- Monitor bot activity during sessions
- Keep API key secure

## Alternative: Manual Mode

If automated bot has issues, you can run in "manual mode":

1. Open ElevenLabs widget in browser
2. Share screen showing the widget
3. Students ask questions in chat
4. You copy/paste to widget
5. Copy/paste responses back

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check ElevenLabs API documentation
- Review console error messages
- Test with a private meeting first
