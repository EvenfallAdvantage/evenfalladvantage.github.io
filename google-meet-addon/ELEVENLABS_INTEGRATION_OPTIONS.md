# ElevenLabs Integration Options

We're getting 404 errors from the ElevenLabs Conversational AI API. Here are the possible solutions:

## Option 1: Use ElevenLabs Widget (Easiest)

ElevenLabs provides an embeddable widget for Conversational AI agents. This would work immediately:

1. Get the widget embed code from your agent settings
2. Embed it in the sidebar
3. Students interact with it directly

**Pros:** Works immediately, no API issues
**Cons:** Less customization

## Option 2: Use WebSocket Connection

Conversational AI might require WebSocket instead of REST API:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/...');
```

Need to find the correct WebSocket endpoint from ElevenLabs docs.

## Option 3: Use ElevenLabs JavaScript SDK

They might have an official SDK:

```javascript
import { ElevenLabs } from '@elevenlabs/sdk';
```

## Option 4: Contact ElevenLabs Support

Get the official API documentation for Conversational AI agents.

## Option 5: Alternative - Simple Q&A System

Create a knowledge base with pre-written answers:
- Fast responses
- No API costs
- Works offline
- You control all content

## What to Check in ElevenLabs Dashboard:

1. Agent Settings → Look for "Embed" or "Widget" code
2. Agent Settings → Look for "API" or "Integration" documentation
3. Main menu → Look for "Developers" or "API Keys" section
4. Check if there's a "Share" or "Publish" option for the agent

**Next Steps:**

Please check your ElevenLabs dashboard for any of the above and let me know what you find!
