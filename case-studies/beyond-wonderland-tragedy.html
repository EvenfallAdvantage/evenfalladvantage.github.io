                <p><strong>For Unarmed Event Security Training<br>
                Date of Incident:</strong> June 17, 2023<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Gorge Amphitheatre, George, Washington<br>
                <strong>Event:</strong> Beyond Wonderland EDM Festival<br>
                <strong>Prepared by:</strong> James "Fergie" Ferguson<br>
                <strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 15, 2025</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>On June 17, 2023, the Beyond Wonderland electronic dance music festival at the Gorge Amphitheatre in Washington state was marred by a mass shooting that left three people dead (including the gunman) and three others injured. The incident occurred in the campground area adjacent to the venue when a 26-year-old attendee, later identified as James Kelly, began hallucinating after consuming psychedelic mushrooms. He retrieved a handgun from his vehicle and opened fire indiscriminately on fellow festival-goers and staff. The tragedy highlights critical vulnerabilities in festival security protocols related to firearms, substances, and mental health crises.</p>
                
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><strong>Event Details:</strong> Beyond Wonderland is a major electronic dance music (EDM) festival organized by Insomniac Events, typically drawing 25,000+ attendees over multiple days. The 2023 event at the Gorge Amphitheatre featured camping options in designated areas adjacent to the main venue.</p>
                <p><strong>Security Staffing:</strong> The festival employed approximately 200 contracted unarmed security personnel in addition to approximately 25 local law enforcement officers. Unarmed security staff were primarily responsible for ID checks, entry screening, crowd management, and monitoring for alcohol/drug policy violations within the venue and camping areas.</p>
                
                <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>June 16-17, 2023:</strong> Festival runs normally during its first day with no major security incidents reported.</li>
                    <li><strong>June 17, 8:20 PM:</strong> James Kelly, who had been camping at the festival, consumed an unknown quantity of psilocybin mushrooms in his tent.</li>
                    <li><strong>9:30 PM:</strong> According to later court documents, Kelly began experiencing severe hallucinations, believing the world was ending and that his neighbors were conspirators.</li>
                    <li><strong>9:40 PM:</strong> Kelly returned to his vehicle where a handgun was stored and retrieved it.</li>
                    <li><strong>9:45 PM:</strong> Kelly opened fire near the campground, first shooting two festival attendees.</li>
                    <li><strong>9:48 PM:</strong> An unarmed security supervisor responding to the initial reports was also shot.</li>
                    <li><strong>9:50 PM:</strong> Local sheriff's deputies responded and confronted Kelly, who continued firing. Deputies returned fire, injuring Kelly who was then taken into custody.</li>
                    <li><strong>10:00 PM:</strong> Festival organizers initiated lockdown protocols within the main venue as law enforcement secured the area. Many attendees were unaware of the situation unfolding in the campground.</li>
                    <li><strong>10:30 PM:</strong> The festival was canceled for the remainder of the night, with a controlled evacuation beginning around 11:30 PM.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Two victims (one attendee and one security staff member) died from their injuries. Three others were hospitalized, including the shooter.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Key Failures in Security and Event Management</h2>
                <h3>Inadequate Vehicle and Camping Security:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Despite prohibited items policies, vehicles entering the campground area were not thoroughly searched for weapons.</li>
                    <li>No clear protocol existed for regular security sweeps of the camping areas once the festival was underway.</li>
                    <li>Campground security staffing was minimal compared to the main venue, creating surveillance gaps.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Insufficient Training for Mental Health Crisis Response:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Security personnel lacked specific training to identify and safely manage attendees experiencing severe substance-induced psychosis or hallucinations.</li>
                    <li>No specialized mental health resources were readily available on-site during the late evening hours.</li>
                    <li>Communication protocols between security staff about potentially dangerous behavioral changes in attendees were undefined.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Delayed Emergency Response and Notification:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Security staff inside the main venue were not immediately notified of the active threat in the campground.</li>
                    <li>The festival lacked a unified emergency alert system to quickly inform all security personnel of critical incidents.</li>
                    <li>The decision to initiate venue lockdown protocols came several minutes after the shooting began.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Communication Breakdown Between Zones:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Radio communication between campground security and main venue security operated on different channels with no efficient cross-communication protocol.</li>
                    <li>Law enforcement and private security used separate communication systems without effective integration.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Human Toll:</strong> Two innocent individuals killed (one attendee and one security staff member), three injured including the perpetrator.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Consequences:</strong> James Kelly was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of first-degree assault. Legal proceedings against the event organizers and security company remain ongoing as of 2025.</li>
                    <li><strong>Industry Changes:</strong> The incident prompted Washington state to review its requirements for security at large outdoor music events, particularly those with overnight camping components.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Lessons for Unarmed Event Security</h2>
                <h3>Enhanced Vehicle and Camping Area Monitoring:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Advocate for thorough vehicle searches at entry points using clear protocols for weapons detection.</li>
                    <li>Implement regular, visible security patrols through camping areas, particularly during high-risk evening hours.</li>
                    <li>Create designated observation points with clear sightlines throughout camping areas.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Substance-Induced Crisis Response:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn to recognize signs of severe substance-induced psychological distress: extreme paranoia, aggression, disorientation.</li>
                    <li>Develop non-confrontational communication techniques specifically for individuals experiencing hallucinations.</li>
                    <li>Establish clear escalation protocols to access medical and mental health support resources quickly.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <blockquote>The Beyond Wonderland tragedy demonstrates how quickly a substance-induced crisis can escalate to violence when weapons are accessible. Unarmed security personnel represent the first line of observation and intervention, making their training in both substance recognition and communication techniques essential to preventing tragedy.</blockquote>
                
                <h2>Recommendations for Event Organizers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zero-Tolerance Weapons Policy:</strong> Implement comprehensive vehicle searches with clear prohibited items policies, particularly for events with overnight camping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mental Health Response Team:</strong> Staff events with qualified mental health professionals trained in substance-induced crisis intervention, available 24/7 during multi-day festivals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unified Communications:</strong> Create an integrated communications system that bridges all security zones, private security, and law enforcement channels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Campground Security:</strong> Implement surveillance cameras, additional lighting, and increased security presence in camping areas, particularly during nighttime hours.</li>
                </ul>
