                <strong>Event:</strong> Faster Horses Country Music Festival<br>
                <strong>Prepared by:</strong> James "Fergie" Ferguson<br>
                <strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 10, 2025</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>On July 17, 2021, during the Faster Horses country music festival in Michigan, a tragic incident occurred when three men in their early 20s were found deceased inside their travel trailer in the festival campground. The cause of death was determined to be carbon monoxide poisoning from a portable generator that had been improperly positioned near the camper's air conditioning unit. The incident highlights critical safety gaps in festival camping operations, particularly regarding supervision of attendee-managed equipment, carbon monoxide awareness, and emergency response protocols in sprawling campgrounds.</p>
                
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><strong>Event Details:</strong> Faster Horses is an annual three-day country music festival held at Michigan International Speedway, typically attracting around 40,000 attendees. The 2021 event ran from July 16-18 and featured camping options spread across extensive grounds surrounding the speedway.</p>
                <p><strong>Security Staffing:</strong> The festival employed approximately 250 contracted security personnel plus local law enforcement. Security staff responsibilities were primarily focused on access control, crowd management inside the venue, and periodic patrols of camping areas.</p>
                <p><strong>Camping Context:</strong> The festival's camping component featured minimal restrictions on personal camping equipment. Many attendees brought generators to power air conditioning units, refrigerators, and other amenities. No formal inspection of this equipment was conducted upon entry.</p>
                
                <h2>Timeline of Events</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>July 16, 2021 (Day 1):</strong> Victims Dawson Brown (20), Kole Sova (19), and Richie Mays Jr. (20), along with two female friends, arrived at the festival and set up their travel trailer in the campground area.</li>
                    <li><strong>July 16, Evening:</strong> The group positioned a portable generator behind their trailer to power an air conditioning unit. The generator was placed near the camper's air intake without adequate ventilation space.</li>
                    <li><strong>July 17, Morning to Afternoon:</strong> The victims attended festival performances. Two female friends in the group spent time away from the trailer attending different performances.</li>
                    <li><strong>July 17, Evening:</strong> The three men returned to their trailer. With dropping temperatures, they closed windows while the generator continued running.</li>
                    <li><strong>July 17, 11:00-11:30 PM:</strong> The two female friends returned to the trailer and found the three men unresponsive. They immediately called for help.</li>
                    <li><strong>July 17, 11:45 PM:</strong> Emergency medical personnel arrived and attempted resuscitation but were unsuccessful. All three men were pronounced dead at the scene from apparent carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Key Failures in Security and Event Management</h2>
                <h3>Lack of Camping Equipment Safety Protocols:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>No formal inspection of generators, propane tanks, or other potential hazards was conducted upon entry to the camping areas.</li>
                    <li>No specific guidelines or requirements regarding generator placement were communicated to campers.</li>
                    <li>No carbon monoxide detectors were required in camping setups that used gas-powered equipment.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Insufficient Camping Area Supervision:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Security patrols in camping areas focused primarily on behavior/rule violations rather than safety hazards.</li>
                    <li>Staff lacked training to identify dangerous equipment setups during their limited patrols.</li>
                    <li>The ratio of security personnel to camping units was inadequate for proper monitoring.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Deficient Safety Communication:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pre-festival communications and on-site signage failed to adequately highlight camping safety concerns, particularly carbon monoxide risks.</li>
                    <li>No safety briefings or information was required before campers could set up their equipment.</li>
                    <li>Emergency contact information was not prominently displayed throughout camping areas.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Response Time Limitations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The sprawling campground layout contributed to delayed emergency response times.</li>
                    <li>Limited lighting in camping areas made locating specific sites difficult after dark.</li>
                    <li>Insufficient emergency access lanes through densely packed camping areas hampered rapid response.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Human Toll:</strong> Three young men lost their lives, with lasting trauma for their families, friends, and the festival community.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Consequences:</strong> While no criminal charges were filed, civil litigation followed against festival organizers Live Nation, Michigan International Speedway, and contracted security firms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Industry Changes:</strong> The incident prompted several major festivals to implement more stringent camping safety protocols, including generator placement guidelines and carbon monoxide detector requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Lessons for Unarmed Event Security</h2>
                <h3>Proactive Hazard Identification:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn to recognize dangerous generator placements: too close to sleeping quarters, inadequately ventilated, or near air intakes.</li>
                    <li>Actively look for safety hazards during campground patrols, not just policy violations.</li>
                    <li>Document and report unsafe conditions even when they don't violate explicit rules.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Safety Communication:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proactively engage with campers about equipment safety, particularly those with generators.</li>
                    <li>Know how to communicate carbon monoxide risks clearly and authoritatively.</li>
                    <li>Document interaction with campers regarding safety issues for accountability.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <blockquote>The Faster Horses tragedy demonstrates how easily preventable deaths can occur when basic safety protocols are overlooked in festival camping operations. While security teams are often focused on crowd management and rule enforcement, the identification of environmental and equipment hazards must become an equally important priority.</blockquote>
                
                <h2>Recommendations for Event Organizers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Equipment Inspection Protocol:</strong> Implement mandatory safety inspections of generators and similar equipment at campground check-in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon Monoxide Prevention:</strong> Provide clear guidelines about generator placement, require carbon monoxide detectors for all camping units using combustion equipment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety-Focused Patrols:</strong> Train and deploy dedicated safety inspection teams separate from security personnel focused on rule enforcement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Response Infrastructure:</strong> Design camping layouts with clearly marked emergency access lanes and location identifiers to enable rapid response.</li>
                </ul>
