# Module 7 - State-Specific Content

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

Module 7 (Legal Aspects & Use of Force) now requires students to select their state before starting. The content is dynamically generated based on the selected state.

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. **State Selection Modal**
When a student clicks "Start Module" for Module 7:
- A modal appears showing all 50 states
- Student selects their state
- Selection is saved to localStorage

### 2. **State-Specific Content**
Each state gets customized slides covering:
- State licensing requirements
- Training hour requirements
- Use of force laws specific to that state
- Citizen's arrest laws

### 3. **Content Source**
All state data comes from `state-laws.js` which contains:
- Licensing requirements

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Created/Modified:
- **Created:** `js/state-selection.js` - State selection logic
- **Modified:** `index.html` - Added script reference
- **Uses:** `js/state-laws.js` - State data source

### Key Functions:
```javascript
showStateSelectionModal()  // Shows state picker
selectState(stateCode)     // Handles selection
startModuleWithState()     // Starts with state content
generateStateSpecificSlides() // Creates slides
```

### Data Flow:
1. User clicks "Start Module" on Module 7
2. Check if state already selected (localStorage)
3. If no state, show selection modal
4. User selects state
5. State saved to localStorage
6. Slides generated with state data
7. Module starts with custom content

## üé® User Experience
